        <h1 id="question">Did you <br>know?</h1>

        <h1 id="questionone"> Your old phone could turned to be a electronic
            waste after you abandoned it and they are super toxic can endangers our life?
        </h1>
        <h2>If you don’t recycle your e-waste you can hurt humans, animals and the environment. There are toxins in
            your electronic waste that causes damage<br> to the earth, humans and animals. Informal recycling markets
            in
            China, India, Pakistan, Vietnam, and the Philippines handle anywhere from 50 percent to 80 percent of the
            world’s e-waste. The export of e-waste by developed countries to developing countries is often done under
            unsafe circumstances.

        <div class="green">
            <p id="ht">Some of the toxic materials that are in electronic waste includes:<br></p>

            <div id="harm"> Antimony: Poisonous<br>
                Arsenic: Poisonous<br>
                Barium: Gastrointestinal, neurological, and cardiovascular toxin<br>
                Beryllium: Carcinogenic, Acute Beryllium Disease<br>
                Cadmium: Carcinogenic, organ toxin<br>
                Chromium: Organ toxin, carcinogenic<br>
                Dioxins: Carcinogenic<br>
                Lead: Central and peripheral nervous system toxin<br>
                Mercury: Central nervous system and endocrine system toxin<br>
                Nickel: Carcinogenic, respiratory toxin<br>
                Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs): Blood, skins, and organ toxin<br>
                Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC): Organ toxin, endocrine disruptor</div>



        </div>
        <div id="right">All of these toxin materials cause major health implication. In the head, it can cause nose
            bleeds, seizures, retardation, child development, and sinus perforations. In the mouth it can cause
            mouth, teeth and gum damage, as well as thyroid damage. It can cause high blood pressure, irregular
            heartbeat, lung damage, asthma, bronchitis and cancer. Other implications can include kidney, liver,
            digestive system damage, fetus neurological damage, ulcers and can even lead to death (Source: Jaymi
            Heimbuch; Treehugger). These health implication are detrimental, not just to people in faraway
            countries but to everyone. Animals and the environment are also affected by e-waste. When electronics
            are incinerated the toxins get released into the atmosphere. Also by the electronic waste sitting there
            in informal e-waste dumps, water is poisoned, air turns toxic, soil becomes dead, and as a result
            wildlife, aquatic life, and plant life all suffer.</div>

        <div id="tet">A small Chinese child sitting among cables and e-waste, Guiyu, China. Much of modern electronic
            equipment contains toxic ingredients. Vast amounts are routinely and often illegally shipped as waste from
            Europe, USA and Japan to countries in Asia as it is easier and cheaper to dump the problem on poorer
            countries with lower environmental standards. This practice exposes the workers and communities involved in
            dismantling e-waste to serious, environmental problems, danger and health hazards. Greenpeace is strongly
            urging major manufactures to exclude toxic materials from their products.

            All things are just showed to you, will be come worse. If you still buying any electronic device just for
            try or follow the fashion. The number of the electronic waste has increase rapidly after the smart phone
            come out. Hence, take a step back and think, how many electronic waste you can safe, if you treat your
            device more carefully and make them live longer. How many life you can safe if you stop getting new phones
            or device just for fun or follow the “fashion”. How many land would still be poison people, after all this
            new launch of new devices. The electronic waste have to be treat in a right way, and people do need to stop
            and slow the produce of these kind of waste for unnecessary purpose. If not, one day <br>the toxic land
            might
            be the one under your feet.
