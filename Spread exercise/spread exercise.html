                A man walks into a bar and calls Chris Cuomo “Fredo.” It doesn’t go great.

                We don’t actually witness the inciting moment, but we know what follows. A bystander films it
                vertically, presumably so he won’t be caught capturing the ordeal on his shaky cellphone. The argument
                has the feel of a schoolyard brawl about to take off. Cuomo is off-duty in a baseball cap, the veneer
                of his suit-and-tie professionalism shed. “My name is Chris Cuomo, I’m an anchor on CNN,” he says. He
                stands face to face with the man who hurled the perceived insult. He calls him a punk. He informs him
                that “Fredo” is “like the N-word” for Italians. He offers to throw him down a flight of stairs.

                His enemy is either feigning stupidity or is genuinely confused: “I thought that’s who you were,” he
                says.

                “Fredo is from ‘The Godfather,’ ” Cuomo responds.“He was their <br>weak brother.”
            </p>
            <h3>
                This isn’t even the first case of Fredo name-calling in national news.
            </h3>
            <p class="bodytextone">
                The other guy may have been borrowing the term “Fredo” from Rush Limbaugh, who enjoys calling Cuomo
                that.It’s in no sense accepted as an ethic slur, but Limbaugh and his adherents certainly don’t intend
                it
                nicely. <br>In “The Godfather,” Fredo Corleone is the middle, forgotten son; his associates view him as
                ineffectual, the worst kind of gangster. The dig of calling someone Fredo is twofold: They get labeled
                not just a Mafioso but
                also a failed, pathetic one.
